This contains code and test files for a LAMMPS implementation of the Si-O interatomic potential outlined in
T. Watanabe, H. Fujiwara, H. Noguchi, T. Hoshino, and I. Ohdomari, Jap. J. Appl. Phys. vol 38 (1999) pp. L366-L369.

The potential can be run by copying the .cpp and .h files to your LAMMPS/src directory and rebuilding LAMMPS.

The test folder contains simple verification tests for the potential.
Currently, only a verification that pure Si(a) matches sw Si is there.
